= Deploying the Compliance Operator

Before you can actually use the operator, you need to make sure it is deployed in the cluster.
First, become kubeadmin, either with oc login or by exporting KUBECONFIG.

You can deploy the Compliance Operator via the Operator Hub available in the OpenShift GUI.

By default, the operator runs in the openshift-compliance namespace, so make sure all namespaced resources like the deployment or the custom resources the operator consumes are created there. However, it is possible for the operator to be deployed in other namespaces as well.

As kubeadmin, select the Compliance Operator in Operator Hub and click install.

To verify the installation. Run below commands:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get sub -nopenshift-compliance
$ oc get ip -nopenshift-compliance
$ oc get csv -nopenshift-compliance
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get sub -nopenshift-compliance
NAME                  PACKAGE               SOURCE             CHANNEL
compliance-operator   compliance-operator   redhat-operators   4.7

$ oc get ip -nopenshift-compliance
NAME            CSV                           APPROVAL    APPROVED
install-s2trr   compliance-operator.v0.1.26   Automatic   true

$ oc get csv -nopenshift-compliance
NAME                          DISPLAY               VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
compliance-operator.v0.1.26   Compliance Operator   0.1.26               Succeeded

At this point, the operator should be up and running and you can verify it by running:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deploy -nopenshift-compliance
$ oc get pods -nopenshift-compliance
----
