The compliance-operator is a OpenShift Operator that allows an administrator to run compliance scans and provide remediations for the issues found. The operator leverages OpenSCAP under the hood to perform the scans.

By default, the operator runs in the openshift-compliance namespace, so make sure all namespaced resources like the deployment or the custom resources the operator consumes are created there. However, it is possible for the operator to be deployed in other namespaces as well.

You can install the Compliance Operator from Operator Hub from within the OpenShift GUI. The operator is called Compliance Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Compliance Operator is available for {op-system-first} deployments only.
